who are struggling with learning and are in need of better topical guidance.
We differ from other software by creating a product that establishes a fun and easy
learning experience with an appealing and professional design at the same time!

## Setup

2. Clone the Treemester [repository](https://github.com/dhbw-ka-pm/tinf22b6-treemester)
3. Open a terminal in the project directory and install the following dependency with the following command: **npm install react-scripts**

Note: The site loads at the first startup longer because missing dependencies are being installed
